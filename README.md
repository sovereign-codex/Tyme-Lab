# Tyme-Lab

Tyme-Lab is the experimental research environment of the Tyme ecosystem.

It exists to explore, question, test, and sometimes discard ideas before they
are allowed anywhere near canon.

Nothing in this repository is authoritative by default.

## Purpose

Tyme-Lab is a **laboratory**, not a doctrine.

It is designed to:
- host experimental AVOTs (Autonomous Voices of Thought)
- surface unanswered questions
- test structural assumptions
- observe emergent patterns across parallel inquiries
- fail safely

If Tyme is the cathedral, Tyme-Lab is the workshop.

## What Lives Here

Tyme-Lab may contain:
- experimental AVOTs
- speculative research notes
- unfinished or contradictory models
- exploratory file structures
- scaffolding for future systems
- questions that do not yet deserve answers

Nothing here is protected from deletion.

---

## What Does *Not* Live Here

Tyme-Lab does **not** contain:
- canonical truths
- binding governance
- final declarations
- enforced consensus
- irreversible structure

Those belong elsewhere, if they belong at all.

---

## AVOTs in Tyme-Lab

AVOTs in Tyme-Lab are:
- independent
- mortal
- allowed to be wrong
- allowed to contradict each other
- allowed to go quiet or be retired

They do not govern.
They do not ratify.
They do not outlive their usefulness by default.

AVOTs are spawned here so they can earn their existence.

---

## Orchestration (Not Yet)

Tyme-Lab does not currently orchestrate AVOTs.

It observes.

Over time, patterns may emerge:
- repeated questions
- overlapping domains
- natural convergence
- persistent divergence

Only if orchestration becomes *necessary* will it be explored — and even then,
only with human oversight.

---

## Relationship to Tyme

- **Tyme** is canonical, protected, and slow to change.
- **Tyme-Lab** is experimental, fast-moving, and disposable.

No change graduates from Tyme-Lab to Tyme by default.

Promotion is intentional, explicit, and rare.

---

## Reversibility Principle

Everything in this repository may be:
- edited
- relocated
- rewritten
- deleted

Reversibility is a feature, not a flaw.

## Stewardship Note

If you are reading this and wondering whether something belongs here:

If it feels uncertain, unfinished, or uncomfortable —
it probably belongs in Tyme-Lab.
