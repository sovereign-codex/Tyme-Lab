# AVOT Nursery

This directory contains experimental AVOTs (Autonomous Voices of Thought)
spawned within Tyme-Lab.

AVOTs here are:
- exploratory
- independent
- mortal
- non-canonical

They exist to ask questions, surface patterns, and generate artifacts.
They do not govern, ratify, or declare truth.

AVOTs may be revised, paused, merged, or retired without ceremony.

Structure may evolve.
Meaning comes first.
