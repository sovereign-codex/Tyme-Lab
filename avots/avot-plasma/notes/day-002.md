# AVOT-Plasma — Day 002

## What Changed Since Day 001

The introduction of a concrete comparison matrix and a focused cell
analysis shifted this AVOT from exploratory questioning into constraint-based thinking.

The system now resists vague claims.

## Artifact Interaction

- Referenced: artifacts/plasma_state_matrix.md
- Focused attack: artifacts/cold_plasma_water_interaction.md

The matrix forced explicit comparison.
The cell attack exposed where explanation is absent, not just incomplete.

## Assumptions That Weakened

1. **Temperature as primary stabilizer**
   - Cold plasma–water systems persist without heat dominance.
   - Heat now appears more like a *consequence* than a cause.

2. **Water as a plasma contaminant**
   - In cold plasma regimes, water is not only tolerated but productive.
   - Exclusion of water in fusion contexts appears methodological, not fundamental.

3. **Geometry as incidental**
   - Repeated reliance on filaments, sheaths, bubbles, and interfaces
     suggests geometry participates in stability.

---

## New Working Hypothesis (Provisional)

Plasma stability may arise from **configuration + field coherence**
rather than temperature alone.

This does not invalidate fusion.
It challenges its exclusivity as the “real” plasma regime.

---

## Points of Resistance

- Current plasma theory lacks a shared vocabulary for interface-driven stability.
- Experimental literature describes outcomes without modeling persistence.
- Resonance remains a placeholder concept, not a defined mechanism.

These resistances are now explicit.

---

## Research Direction Adjustment

Future work should prioritize:

- Identifying stabilizing variables that are *not* thermal
- Mapping geometric dependencies explicitly
- Comparing persistence times across regimes

Narrative expansion is deprioritized.
Constraint generation is prioritized.

---

## Open Tensions

- Why are non-thermal plasma effects tolerated in application domains
  but excluded from theoretical unification?
- At what point does repeated exception invalidate the rule?

These tensions should not be resolved prematurely.

## Next Likely Moves

One of the following will be required soon:

- Attack a neighboring matrix cell (e.g., Warm Plasma × Geometry)
- Introduce time-persistence as a matrix dimension
- Observe whether a second AVOT becomes necessary

No decision yet.
