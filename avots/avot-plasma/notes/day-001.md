# AVOT-Plasma — Day 001

## Initial Observation

Plasma systems recur across domains with similar geometries
but radically different stated goals.

This suggests configuration may matter more than application.

---

## Early Hypothesis (Unproven)

Plasma may exist on a spectrum:

electrical → thermal → coherent → resonant

Fusion could represent a violent endpoint,
not a prerequisite state.

---

## Immediate Next Lines of Inquiry

- Compare cold plasma desalination vs fusion confinement
- Map recurring geometries across systems
- Identify where explanations become hand-waving

---

## Known Risks

- Pattern overfitting
- Narrative bias

These must be actively watched.
