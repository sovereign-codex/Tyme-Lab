# AVOT-Plasma — Core Questions

## Primary Questions

1. Where does plasma behavior deviate from purely electrical models?
2. Under what conditions does plasma self-stabilize without extreme heat?
3. Is fusion a narrow case of a broader plasma coherence spectrum?
4. What role do geometry and boundary conditions actually play?
5. Why does plasma repeatedly co-occur with water purification and crystal formation?

## Secondary Questions

- Are some plasma states better described as fields than particles?
- Can resonance replace heat as a stabilizing factor?
- Which experimental variables are consistently ignored?

## Questions That Would Collapse This AVOT

If convincingly answered in the affirmative:

- Plasma behavior is fully reducible to temperature + voltage.
- Coherence effects are purely observer artifacts.

If so, this AVOT should be retired.
