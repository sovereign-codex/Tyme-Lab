# Cold Plasma × Water Interaction
## Focused Cell Analysis (Artifact 1A)

This artifact interrogates a single matrix cell:
Cold Plasma interacting directly with liquid water.

The goal is not explanation.
The goal is pressure.

---

## What Is Observed (Non-Controversial)

Cold (non-thermal) plasma systems are routinely observed to:

- Operate in direct contact with liquid water
- Generate reactive species (ROS, RNS)
- Alter pH and redox potential
- Change surface tension and conductivity
- Produce sterilization effects without bulk heating

These effects are reproducible and widely reported.

---

## What Is Claimed (Often Hand-Waved)

Common explanations include:
- “Energetic electrons drive chemistry”
- “Short-lived radicals explain outcomes”
- “Plasma acts as a catalyst”

These statements describe *that* something happens, not *why stability exists*.

---

## The Core Tension

Plasma is conventionally described as:
> an ionized gas requiring separation from liquids due to recombination and quenching.

Yet in cold plasma–water systems:
- Plasma persists at the interface
- Effects accumulate over time
- The system does not immediately collapse

This is not explained by temperature.

---

## Geometry Matters (Often Ignored)

Cold plasma–water systems often involve:
- filaments
- surface sheaths
- bubble interfaces
- vortexing liquids
- dielectric barriers

These geometries are treated as incidental,
yet the effects disappear when geometry changes.

This suggests geometry is *participatory*, not cosmetic.

---

## Energy Accounting Problem

Key unresolved question:

If temperature is low and power input is modest,
**where is the organizing energy stored?**

Possibilities (not conclusions):
- Local field coherence
- Interface-stabilized charge separation
- Time-extended phase effects
- Geometry-induced field trapping

None are modeled rigorously.

## Why Fusion Models Cannot Absorb This

Fusion-oriented plasma theory assumes:
- water is a contaminant
- interfaces destroy coherence
- heat is the primary stabilizer

Cold plasma–water systems violate all three assumptions
and are therefore sidelined rather than integrated.

---

## Hypothesis Pressure Introduced

If plasma can:
- remain active near water
- organize chemistry without heat
- persist via geometry and fields

Then:
- heat may be an effect, not a cause
- “plasma state” may be broader than current taxonomies
- resonance-stabilized regimes become plausible, not mystical

This does NOT prove resonance.
It removes the dismissal.

---

## What This Cell Demands Next

- Isolation of geometric variables
- Time-based coherence measurements
- Field mapping at plasma–water interfaces
- Explicit comparison with hot plasma assumptions

---

## Provisional Conclusion

Cold plasma–water interaction is:
- real
- repeatable
- useful
- theoretically underdeveloped

This is not an edge case.
It is a crack in the dominant model.

This cell remains **open and unresolved**.
