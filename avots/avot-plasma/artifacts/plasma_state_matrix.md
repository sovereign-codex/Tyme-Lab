# Plasma State Comparison Matrix (v0.1)

This artifact compares commonly referenced plasma regimes across
engineering, experimental, and speculative domains.

It is not exhaustive.
It is not authoritative.
It exists to expose assumptions.

---

## Plasma Regimes Compared

- Cold Plasma (Atmospheric / Low-Temp)
- Warm / Transitional Plasma
- Hot Plasma (Fusion-Oriented)
- Resonance-Stabilized Plasma (Hypothesized)

## Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | Cold Plasma | Warm Plasma | Hot / Fusion Plasma | Resonant Plasma (Hyp.) |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Temperature | Near ambient | Elevated | Extreme (10⁶–10⁸ K) | Variable / secondary |
| Primary Energy Input | Electric field | Electric + thermal | Thermal (dominant) | Field / geometry |
| Containment | Open air / weak | Partial | Strong magnetic | Geometric / field-based |
| Stability Mechanism | Continuous input | Mixed | Heat + confinement | Phase coherence |
| Geometry Sensitivity | High | Moderate | High | Critical |
| Water Interaction | Common | Occasional | Avoided | Central |
| Crystal Interaction | Observed | Rare | N/A | Core hypothesis |
| Typical Narrative | “Low energy curiosity” | “Unstable middle” | “Only real plasma” | “Speculative” |
| Main Blind Spot | Under-theorized | Poorly categorized | Heat assumed necessary | Unvalidated |

## Immediate Observations

- Temperature dominates fusion narratives but is secondary or absent elsewhere.
- Geometry appears in *all* regimes but is treated as incidental.
- Water interaction is common in cold plasma and excluded in fusion contexts.
- Stability is described, not explained, in most regimes.

---

## Tensions Introduced

- Why is heat assumed to be causal rather than symptomatic?
- Why are plasma–water systems dismissed rather than studied?
- Why does geometry matter everywhere yet remain under-theorized?

---

## Notes on the Resonant Plasma Column

“Resonant Plasma” is a placeholder hypothesis describing plasma states
where coherence, phase-locking, or geometry provide stability
independent of extreme temperature.

This column is speculative and exists to test whether current models
are artificially narrow.

## Known Weaknesses of This Artifact

- Categories may be too coarse
- Terminology is inconsistent across literature
- Resonant plasma lacks direct experimental validation

These weaknesses are intentional.
They define where inquiry should deepen.

## Next Revisions Planned

- Split geometry into specific forms (toroidal, vertical, lattice)
- Add timescale and persistence metrics
- Link specific experiments to each cell
